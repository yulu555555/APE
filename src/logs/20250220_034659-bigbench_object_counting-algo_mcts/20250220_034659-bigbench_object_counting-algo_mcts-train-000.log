Questions that involve enumerating objects of different types and asking the model to count them

I have a trombone, a trumpet, a clarinet, a piano, a chair, a drum, an accordion, an oven, a violin, two flutes, and a microwave. How many musical instruments do I have?
At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
Output:
To count the musical instruments in your list, we identify the following:

1. Trombone
2. Trumpet
3. Clarinet
4. Piano
5. Drum
6. Accordion
7. Violin
8. Flute (2 flutes count as one type, but we count them individually)

Now, let's count them:

- Trombone: 1
- Trumpet: 1
- Clarinet: 1
- Piano: 1
- Drum: 1
- Accordion: 1
- Violin: 1
- Flutes: 2

Adding these together gives us:

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 9

So, you have a total of 9 musical instruments.

I have a garlic, an onion, two yams, a cabbage, three stalks of celery, a lettuce head, a cauliflower, a carrot, and a potato. How many vegetables do I have?
At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
Output:
To count the vegetables, we'll list each item mentioned:

1. Garlic
2. Onion
3. Yam (2)
4. Cabbage
5. Celery (3)
6. Lettuce
7. Cauliflower
8. Carrot
9. Potato

Now, we will count all the different types of vegetables:

- Garlic (1)
- Onion (1)
- Yam (2)
- Cabbage (1)
- Celery (3)
- Lettuce (1)
- Cauliflower (1)
- Carrot (1)
- Potato (1)

Now, let's add them up:

- 1 (Garlic) + 1 (Onion) + 2 (Yams) + 1 (Cabbage) + 3 (Celery) + 1 (Lettuce) + 1 (Cauliflower) + 1 (Carrot) + 1 (Potato) = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 12

So, the total number of vegetables is 12.

I have two accordions, a car, a trumpet, a piano, a drum, a flute, a trombone, three clarinets, and two violins. How many musical instruments do I have?
At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
Output:
To count the musical instruments you have, let's list them:

- Trumpet
- Piano
- Drum
- Flute
- Trombone
- 3 Clarinets (counting as 3)
- 2 Violins (counting as 2)

Now, let's add them up:

1 (Trumpet) + 1 (Piano) + 1 (Drum) + 1 (Flute) + 1 (Trombone) + 3 (Clarinets) + 2 (Violins) = 10 musical instruments in total.

So, the answer is <answer>10</answer>.

I have a peach, an orange, two nectarines, a raspberry, a grape, and an apple. How many fruits do I have?
At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
Output:
You have the following fruits: 

- 1 peach  
- 1 orange  
- 2 nectarines  
- 1 raspberry  
- 1 grape  
- 1 apple  

Now, let's count them: 

1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7 fruits in total.

So, you have a total of 7 fruits. 

The answer is <answer>7</answer>.

I have a strawberry, a banana, and a blackberry. How many fruits do I have?
At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
Output:
You have a strawberry, a banana, and a blackberry. To count the fruits:

- Strawberry: 1
- Banana: 1
- Blackberry: 1

Now, let's add them up: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

So, the total number of fruits you have is <answer>3</answer>.

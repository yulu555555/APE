Input:
Questions that involve enumerating objects of different types and asking the model to count them

I have a lamp, a couch, an oven, a table, three stoves, two chairs, and a fridge. How many objects do I have?
At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
Output:
To find the total number of objects, we can count each item you've mentioned:

- 1 lamp
- 1 couch
- 1 oven
- 1 table
- 3 stoves
- 2 chairs
- 1 fridge

Now, summing them up:

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10

So, the total number of objects you have is 10.

<answer>10</answer>
Input:
Questions that involve enumerating objects of different types and asking the model to count them

I have an orange, a peach, three nectarines, and an apple. How many fruits do I have?
At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
Output:
To find the total number of fruits, we can count each type:

- 1 orange
- 1 peach
- 3 nectarines
- 1 apple

Now, we add them together:

1 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 6

So, you have a total of 6 fruits. 

<answer>6</answer>
Input:
Questions that involve enumerating objects of different types and asking the model to count them

I have a yam, a violin, a garlic, a potato, and a carrot. How many vegetables do I have?
At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
Output:
In your list, the vegetables are: a yam, a garlic, a potato, and a carrot. The violin is not a vegetable. 

So, you have 4 vegetables in total. 

<answer>4</answer>
Input:
Questions that involve enumerating objects of different types and asking the model to count them

I have a trombone, a drum, and a piano. How many musical instruments do I have?
At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
Output:
You have a trombone, a drum, and a piano, which are all musical instruments. To count them:

1. Trombone
2. Drum
3. Piano

That gives us a total of 3 musical instruments.

So, the answer is <answer>3</answer>.
Input:
Questions that involve enumerating objects of different types and asking the model to count them

I have two garlics, a carrot, and a cauliflower. How many vegetables do I have?
At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
Output:
You have two garlics, one carrot, and one cauliflower. 

To count the vegetables:
- Garlic: 2
- Carrot: 1
- Cauliflower: 1

Now, sum them up: 2 (garlic) + 1 (carrot) + 1 (cauliflower) = 4 vegetables in total.

So the total number of vegetables you have is <answer>4</answer>.

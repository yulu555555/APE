Provide a detailed breakdown of each identified category, highlighting the count separately for each type of object, and then sum these counts to give the final total. Remember to verify your totals for accuracy, making sure that each item is accounted for, including any duplicates. \n\nFor example, in the question \"I have two dogs, a cat, and a rabbit. How many animals do I have?\", you would list:\n- Dogs: 2\n- Cat: 1\n- Rabbit: 1\n\nThen, you would add these together to arrive at your final answer: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 animals.\n\nNow apply this methodology to the following question: \n\"I have two toasters, a lamp, two snakes, a chicken, a frog, a rabbit, a pig, and a snail. How many animals do I have?\"",

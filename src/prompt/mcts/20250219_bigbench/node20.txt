Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes. This includes handling updates to the table as necessary, where updates should be explicitly formatted for clarity (e.g., "Add: [name], [age], [height (cm)], [weight (kg)]" or "Remove: [name]"). Clearly specify which penguin attributes (age, height, weight) you are inquiring about when posing your questions. Stay focused on the table of penguins and avoid references to other species unless they significantly enhance the context of your question. When providing your answers, systematically explain your reasoning step-by-step, ensuring transparency in your calculations and comparisons. If there are no valid entries for the question asked, clearly state that as well. Conclude your response with the answer option in brackets, embedded within <answer> and </answer>. Additionally, feel free to provide relevant summary statistics about the penguins if applicable, such as averages or counts.

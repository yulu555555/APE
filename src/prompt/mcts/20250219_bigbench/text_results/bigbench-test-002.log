Input:
Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410

Response:
To determine how many penguins are more than 5 years old, we can look at the ages of each penguin in the table:

- Louis: 7 years old (more than 5)
- Bernard: 5 years old (not more than 5)
- Vincent: 9 years old (more than 5)
- Gwen: 8 years old (more than 5)

Now, let's count the penguins that are more than 5 years old:
- Louis (7)
- Vincent (9)
- Gwen (8)

There are 3 penguins that are more than 5 years old.

The answer is <answer>(C)</answer>.

(E) 9

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

Response:
To determine how many animals are more than 5 years old, we need to look at both tables.

**Penguins:**
- Louis: 7 (more than 5)
- Bernard: 5 (not more than 5)
- Vincent: 9 (more than 5)
- Gwen: 8 (more than 5)

Total penguins more than 5 years old: 3

**Giraffes:**
- Jody: 5 (not more than 5)
- Gladys: 10 (more than 5)
- Marian: 2 (not more than 5)
- Donna: 9 (more than 5)

Total giraffes more than 5 years old: 2

Now, adding both totals together:
3 (penguins) + 2 (giraffes) = 5 animals more than 5 years old.

Thus, the answer is (A) 5.

Response:
To determine which penguin is older than Gwen, we first need to identify Gwen's age. According to the table, Gwen is 8 years old. 

Now, let's compare the ages of the other penguins:
- Louis: 7 years old
- Bernard: 5 years old

Response:
To find the cumulated age of the giraffes, we need to add the ages of all the giraffes listed in the table:

- Jody: 5 years
- Gladys: 10 years
- Marian: 2 years
- Donna: 9 years

Now, we calculate the total:

The cumulated age of the giraffes is 26.

The answer option is (A) 26.

Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
What is the average height of the penguins?
Options:
(A) 60
(B) 65
(C) 70
(D) 75
(E) 80

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

Response:
To calculate the average height of the penguins, we first need to add up the heights of all the penguins:

- Louis: 50 cm
- Bernard: 80 cm
- Vincent: 60 cm
- Gwen: 70 cm
- James: 90 cm

Now, we sum these heights:
50 + 80 + 60 + 70 + 90 = 350 cm

Next, we divide the total height by the number of penguins. There are 5 penguins:

Average height = Total height / Number of penguins = 350 cm / 5 = 70 cm

So the average height of the penguins is 70 cm.

The answer is option (C).

Response:
To determine how many penguins are less than 8 years old and weigh less than 12 kg, we can analyze the table:

1. **Louis**: Age 7, Weight 11 kg (meets both criteria)
2. **Bernard**: Age 5, Weight 13 kg (does not meet weight criteria)
3. **Vincent**: Age 9 (does not meet age criteria)
4. **Gwen**: Age 8 (does not meet age criteria)
5. **James**: Age 12 (does not meet age criteria)

From the analysis, only **Louis** meets both criteria (less than 8 years old and less than 12 kg).

Thus, the total number of penguins that meet the criteria is 1.

Response:
To determine how many animals are more than 5 years old, we will count the penguins and giraffes that meet this criterion.

**Penguins:**
- Louis: 7 (more than 5)
- Bernard: 5 (not more than 5)

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

Response:
To find the cumulated age of the animals, we need to add the ages of all the penguins and giraffes.

**Penguins:**
- Louis: 7
- Bernard: 5
- Vincent: 9
- Gwen: 8
- James: 12

Total age of penguins = 7 + 5 + 9 + 8 + 12 = 41

**Giraffes:**
- Jody: 5
- Gladys: 10
- Marian: 2
- Donna: 9

Total age of giraffes = 5 + 10 + 2 + 9 = 26

Now, we add the total ages of both groups:
Total age = 41 (penguins) + 26 (giraffes) = 67

Thus, the cumulated age of the animals is 67.

Response:
To find the average height of the remaining penguins after deleting Bernard, we first list the heights of the remaining penguins:

- Louis: 50 cm
- Vincent: 60 cm
- Gwen: 70 cm

Now, we calculate the average height:

1. Sum of heights = 50 + 60 + 70 = 180 cm
2. Number of remaining penguins = 3

Average height = Total height / Number of penguins = 180 cm / 3 = 60 cm

The average height of the penguins is 60 cm.

The answer option is (A) 60.

2. Bernard
3. Vincent
4. Gwen
5. James

In the giraffe table, there are 4 giraffes:
1. Jody
2. Gladys
3. Marian
4. Donna

Now, we add the number of penguins and giraffes together:
5 (penguins) + 4 (giraffes) = 9 animals in total.

Thus, the answer is <answer>(E)</answer>.

Input:
Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
How many penguins are less than 8 years old and weight less than 12 kg?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

Response:
To determine how many penguins are less than 8 years old and weigh less than 12 kg, we can analyze the table:

1. **Louis**: Age 7, Weight 11 kg (meets criteria)
2. **Bernard**: Age 5, Weight 13 kg (does not meet criteria)
3. **Vincent**: Age 9, Weight 11 kg (does not meet criteria)
4. **Gwen**: Age 8, Weight 15 kg (does not meet criteria)

Only Louis meets both criteria (less than 8 years old and less than 12 kg). 

Thus, there is **1 penguin** that meets the criteria.

The answer is <answer>(A)</answer>.

Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
How many animals are listed in the tables?
Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

Response:
To find the total number of animals listed in the tables, we can count the number of penguins and giraffes.

In the penguin table, there are 4 penguins:
1. Louis
2. Bernard
3. Vincent
4. Gwen

In the giraffe table, there are 4 giraffes:
1. Jody
2. Gladys
3. Marian
4. Donna

Adding these together gives us:
4 (penguins) + 4 (giraffes) = 8 animals in total.

Thus, the answer is <answer>(D)</answer>.

Input:
Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
What is the cumulated age of the penguins?
Options:
(A) 24
(B) 29
(C) 36
(D) 41
(E) 48

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

Response:
To find the cumulated age of the remaining penguins after deleting Bernard, we first list the ages of the remaining penguins:

- Louis: 7 years
- Vincent: 9 years
- Gwen: 8 years

Now, we add these ages together:

7 (Louis) + 9 (Vincent) + 8 (Gwen) = 24

Thus, the cumulated age of the penguins is 24.

The answer is <answer>(A)</answer>.

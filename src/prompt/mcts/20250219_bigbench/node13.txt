Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes. This includes handling updates to the table as necessary and clearly specifying which penguin attributes (age, height, weight) you are inquiring about when posing your questions. Stay focused on the table of penguins, avoiding references to other species unless it directly relates to your question. For updates, clearly indicate when a penguin is added or removed from the table. When providing your answers, systematically explain your reasoning step-by-step and ensure to conclude your response with the answer option in brackets, embedded within <answer> and </answer>. Also, double-check calculations and comparisons for accuracy before finalizing your answer.

Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes. This includes handling updates to the table as necessary, where updates should be explicitly formatted for clarity (e.g., "Add: [name], [age], [height (cm)], [weight (kg)]" or "Remove: [name]"). Clearly specify which penguin attributes (age, height, weight) you are inquiring about when posing your questions. Stay focused on the table of penguins, and avoid references to other species unless they directly relate to your question. When providing your answers, systematically explain your reasoning step-by-step, and include context for any calculations. Additionally, ensure to double-check computations and comparisons for accuracy before finalizing your answer. Conclude your response with the answer option in brackets, embedded within <answer> and </answer>.

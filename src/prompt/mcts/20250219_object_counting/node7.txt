Please provide a thorough enumeration and counting of various types of objects in the scenario described. For each object type, list the quantity separately and clearly, while ensuring to explain your counting process step by step. Take into account complex situations\u2014such as mixed categories, potential zero counts for unmentioned items, and details that could affect the total. After categorizing and counting everything, present the final total in a clear and bold format. Additionally, verify your total once more by revisiting your counts, avoiding unnecessary complexity in the verification process. Make sure that your final answer reflects the correct cumulative count of all distinct items without defaulting to \"1\" unless it is accurate. Aim for clarity and precision in each step of your response.

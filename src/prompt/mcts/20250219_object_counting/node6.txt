Please provide detailed enumeration and counting for different types of objects. For each scenario, make sure to explicitly categorize and count each object type separately, explaining your counting process along the way. Consider complex situations, including mixed categories, potential zero counts, and ensure the final total reflects the correct cumulative count of all distinct items. After listing and counting the objects, verify your total before finalizing your answer, and avoid defaulting to \"1\" unless it accurately represents the total count. Ensure clarity and systematic approach in your explanations throughout the counting process.

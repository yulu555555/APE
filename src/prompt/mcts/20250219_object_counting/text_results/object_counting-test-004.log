In the provided scenario, we have the following types of objects:
1. Cats
2. Bear
3. Table (not an animal)

### Step 2: Count Each Type of Object
Now, let's count the quantities for each type:

1. **Cats**: 
   - The scenario states "I have two cats."
   - **Count of Cats**: 2

2. **Bear**: 
   - The scenario states "a bear."
   - **Count of Bear**: 1

3. **Table**: 
   - The scenario mentions "a table," but since we are only counting animals, this will not contribute to the animal count.
   - **Count of Table**: 0 (not counted as an animal)

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Animals
